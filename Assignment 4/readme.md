HI !!!!

I am pretty happy with this project, the goal was to create a webapp that interacts with javascript in some way. There are some more specific parameters but they generally relate to expressing an understanding of basic JS integration. What I made is a demo of a little form submitter and form receiver tool. The Form receiver and viewer is slightly more JS heavy. This project involved capturing all entry data on the submittal button press, and sending that data as an array into an array. This creates a 2D array that I can reference on the Receiver tool. The Receiver tool shows a list on the left of current form submittions, and clicking on those pulls up that specific forms data. This was really cool, and makes me realize how flexible you can make your webpage when you start to include JS. I will attach my Design and screenshots of the project below. 

Here is the rough idea I had planned :

Here is what I ended up with :

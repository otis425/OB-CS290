For this assignment I made a pretty rudimentary sketch of a type of portfolio or blog :

![portfolio_design](https://github.com/otis425/OB-CS290/assets/71042122/1a33a8a8-5669-4d35-88fc-bf0a87c3ecef)

I think I did alright, but I definitely got lost trying to implement all my styling without adding a CSS file. I think I probably could've 
simplified this rough draft by just using raw html with minimal styling. To get it closer to the intended design though, I made an attempt with the styles.
